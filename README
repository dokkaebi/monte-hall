Monty Hall problem simulation.

Usage:

Run an interpreter and import monty_hall.py:

 $ python -i monty_hall.py

Initialize a simulation. It accepts (number-of-runs, strategy, guess) as parameters. Guess is
randomized by default. Strategy options are Simulation.KEEP and Simulation.SWITCH.

 >>> s = Simulation(1000, Simulation.KEEP)

Run the simulation. Output is (number-of-runs, number-correct).

 >>> s.run()
 (1000, 334)
